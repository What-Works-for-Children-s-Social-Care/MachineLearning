The numbered Jupyter Notebooks were used to build the models for one local authority. 1) was used to build the structured dataset. It is missing as it would have identified the local authority (and we agreed with the local authorities that they would be anonymous for the purposes of this project). The code to produce the models for the other 3 LAs is very similar.

The non-numbered Jupyter Notebooks combine the information produced about the models from the 4 local authorities to produce summary information in the report.

We share the code for the purpose of transparency and to allow others to use it (under a GNU General Public Licence 3.0) if they find it useful.
